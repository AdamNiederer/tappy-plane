# Tappy Plane
A collection of scripts used for a Unity clone of Flappy Bird. I wrote this way
before I knew how to code properly, so there's a lot to be desired. No assets
included, as I don't own the rights to most of them. I recommend using the CC0
assets from kenney.nl to build this game - that's what I used.

This is mostly here for archival purposes. It's not representative of how I
approach software projects nowadays.
